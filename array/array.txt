With arrays you have to understand how can you optimize the solution with a trick,
even before you start writing the code

Techniques:

-Sliding window
-Two pointers
-Traversing from the right
-Sorting the array
-Precomputation --> using hashing or a prefix/suffix sum/product 
-Index as a hash key
-Traversing the array more than once
